# *Slurm* tests

Minimal set of *Slurm* tests showing how to use *Python*'s and *Rust*'s *subprocess* module to interact with *Slurm*.

No proper error checking performed in the *Python* tests.

*Rust* requires all error conditions to be checked for the code to compile, and therefore full error checking is implemented.

*Rust* tests also include more robust parsing of returned results and lazy evaluation.
